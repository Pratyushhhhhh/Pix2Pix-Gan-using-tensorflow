### **Project Summary**  
This project enhances the **Pix2Pix framework** to convert input sketches into photorealistic images. It utilizes paired datasets like **Anime Sketch Colorization Pair** and **Sketch2Pokemon** for training and evaluation. The model is built using a **U-Net generator** and a **PatchGAN discriminator**, ensuring high-quality outputs by preserving structural details and enhancing realism.  

### **Architecture Details**  
- **U-Net Generator:**  
  - Based on an **encoder-decoder structure** with **skip connections**.  
  - The **encoder** extracts hierarchical features by progressively downsampling the input sketch.  
  - The **decoder** reconstructs the image by upsampling, with skip connections helping retain fine details.  
  - This structure ensures **sharp and high-quality image generation**.  

- **PatchGAN Discriminator:**  
  - Instead of classifying the entire image, **PatchGAN evaluates smaller patches** (e.g., 70×70).  
  - Helps maintain **local texture consistency** and enhances **fine-grained details**.  
  - Ensures that generated images look **realistic** rather than blurry.  

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Preprocessing & Augmentation:**  
   - Techniques like **resizing, normalization, flipping, and rotation** improve data diversity.  
✅ **Loss Functions:**  
   - Uses a combination of **adversarial loss (from PatchGAN)** and **L1 loss** for better realism and structure retention.  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Uses **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)** to measure output quality.  
✅ **Applications:**  
   - **Artistic rendering, image restoration, and creative design**.  

### **Implementation & Future Work**  
- Implemented using **TensorFlow in Google Colab** with **GPU acceleration** for efficiency.
- The model is hosted on a web application, allowing users to upload sketches and generate photorealistic images in real-time.
- Future improvements could include:
  - Training with **larger datasets**.  
  - **Optimizing the architecture** for better performance.  
  - Expanding to **unpaired or real-time image translation** scenarios.
